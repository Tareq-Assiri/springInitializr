# spring initializr
someone said that this is a feature that makes intellij ultimate worth paying for.

so this is a script that I wrote in about an hour after to show him that it's not that hard of a feature to implement.

I know it ain't much but it's honest work and it makes my life a bit easier,and I can use it from the comfort of my neovim *PDE*.
